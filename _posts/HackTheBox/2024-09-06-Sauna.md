## Machine Information

> ### **Synopsis**

Sauna is an easy difficulty Windows machine that features Active Directory enumeration and exploitation. Possible usernames can be derived from employee full names listed on the website. With these usernames, an ASREPRoasting attack can be performed, which results in hash for an account that doesn't require Kerberos pre-authentication. This hash can be subjected to an offline brute force attack, in order to recover the plaintext password for a user that is able to WinRM to the box. Running WinPEAS reveals that another system user has been configured to automatically login and it identifies their password. This second user also has Windows remote management permissions. BloodHound reveals that this user has the _DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All_ extended right, which allows them to dump password hashes from the Domain Controller in a DCSync attack. Executing this attack returns the hash of the primary domain administrator, which can be used with Impacket's psexec.py in order to gain a shell on the box as `NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.

## **Recon**

Let's start by enumerating active services in the machine, we can use nmap in order to do this, besides of running nmap scripts, and enumerating versions.

```bash
❯ sudo nmap -p- -sSVC --min-rate 7000 --min-parallelism 100 -oN machine_services.txt -n 10.10.10.175

We can see some interesting services running on the machine. Since it is running DNS, Kerberos, LDAP, etc; we can assume that we're dealing with a domain controller. We can also see that the server is hosting a web server, so we definitely we must take a look at it.

First, let's obtain the domain name in order to add it to our hosts file. We can use `crackmapexec` for this.

```sh
❯ crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.175
SMB         10.10.10.175    445    SAUNA            [*] Windows 10 / Server 2019 Build 17763 x64 (name:SAUNA) (domain:EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
```

Now `egotistical-bank.local` will be resolved
![img_2](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_2.png)

We can attempt to get null or anonymous sessions on SMB or LDAP, but note that this is likely to fail. So let's take a look at the website...

### **Analyzing the Website**

It appears to be a bank's website, but I didn't find anything interesting. There are some contact forms, but they don't work, we'll receive a `Method not allowed` HTTP response. I prefer to not to put effort into trying to making them work.
![img_3](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_3.png)

If we scroll down in the `about.html` page, we will find the following:
![img_4](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_4.png)
We see that there are some employee names. We can use these names to create a username wordlist to try to find valid usernames in the domain.
Who knows?, they might have domain accounts, let's figure out.

To achieve this, I've created a basic Node.js tool that will do exactly what we need, you can download it from it's GitHub repository:
[AD-Username-Generator](https://github.com/Eliud1013/AD-Username-Generator)

### **Generating a username wordlist**

We can use `curl` and `grep` using LookAround expressions to easily extract the employes names the from the about webpage.
Alternatively, we could simply copy the names and paste them into a file manually. I preffer to complicate things to myself.
![img_5](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_5.png)

Well, once we have the employee names in a file, we can run the script to generate possible Active Directory usernames.
![img_6](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_6.png)
There is also a great tool for generating this type of wordlist. You can download it from its GitHub repository if you prefer using Python: [username-list-generator
](https://github.com/captain-noob/username-wordlist-generator)

Nice, now that we've got a username wordlist, we can use `Kerbrute` to enumerate valid users through Kerberos. Kerbrute will request a TGT for every user in the wordlist without providing a password. If the user exists, the KDC will notify us that the user does not have the `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH` flag set. If the user does not exists, the KDC will return an `ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN` error. This way, `Kerbrute` can determine wheter a user exists or not.
Obviusly, if the user has the `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH` flag set, `Kerbrute` will mark the user as valid.
![img_7](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_7.png)
Cool, we've enumerated one valid user, that might be enough. Let's find out.

### AS-REP Roasting

Now that we've found a valid user, we can use `impacket-NPUsers` to check whether `FSmith` requires pre-authentication or not.

![img_9](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_9.png)

Great, `FSmith` does not require pre-authentication to request a TGT from the KDC. This means we can send a `KRB_AS_REQ` message without providing the user password which will let us receive a `KRB_AS_REP` message, which contains the `TGT`, and the following items encrypted with a secret key derived from the user's password:

- Session Key
- TGT Expiration Time
- User Nonce

So, when we attempt to take advantage of a user who has the `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH` flag set, we're going to focus on bruteforce the mentioned package, not directly the TGT as the TGT is encrypted using a secret key derived from the user `krbtgt` password, which is a very large password. Although we don't need to worry about this, as Hashcat will do all the stuff for us but is good to know this kind of things. Anyway we can refer to this process as `TGT Cracking`.
Here we can take a look in the `KRB_AS_REP` package from Wireshark:
![img_8](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_8.png)

We can see that there are two encrypted parts (enc-part): one is in the `ticket` part, which is the TGT , and the another at the same ticket level; is the data that the user can decrypt with his password.

Now if we see again the encrypted data that we obtain using `impacket-NPUsers`, we'll notice that is exactly the same value that we obtain from Wireshark in the user encrypted part (59b7fd23ed.....) but with some additional information that will help cracking tools to recognize the format (`$krb5asrep$23$fsmith@EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL:`).

---

## **Foothold**

### **Cracking the Ticket**

To crack the TGT we can use several tools, I prefer to use `Hashcat`, but `John` is a great option too.
Hashcat need us to provide a `hash mode` with `-m` parameter. We can find the mode for `AS-REP` with the following command:
![img_10](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_10.png)

Nice, the appropiate mode is `18200`, now let's see if we can get the password.

> Used command:

```bash
❯ hashcat -m 18200 -a 0 ./fsmith.kirbi  /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

> Output:

![img_11](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_11.png)
And we've got the password for the `FSmith` user:
**Thestrokes23**

### **Logging in as user FSmith**

Now we can use `PywerView` to see which domain groups `FSmith` belongs to.
![img_12](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_12.png)

Remote Management Users... Nice, in that case let's get shell using `evil-winrm` and read the user flag.
![img_13](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_13.png)

## **Privilege Escalation**

### **System Enumeration**

Now that we've obtained a shell, we will proceed to enumerate the system. To do this, I'm going to use `WinPeas.exe`. Let's see what we can find.
![img_14](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_14.png)

If we search for the `password` keyword, we'll find plain text autologon credentials for the user `svc_loanmanager`. I really got stuck with these credentials, because the user is actually `svc_loanmgr` and not `svc_loanmanager` , I guess the registry hive for autologons is outdated. Anyway, if we list user directories in `C:\Users\`, we'll find the real username.

![img_15](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_15.png)

Well, now let's use `evil-winrm` again with these new credentials and continue enumerating with this new user.
Since we have a service account we should consider using `Bloodhound` to easily look at that privileges do we have in the domain.

I'm gonna use `SharpHound` to collect the domain data, you can download it from its GitHub repository:
[SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound).

### **DCSync**

If we filter by Principals with DCSync rights, we'll see the following:
![img_16](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_16.png)
The user `svc_loanmgr` has `DCSync` rights; kinda strange permissions for a service account meant to manage loans.

To exploit a domain using `DCSync` rights, we essentially tell the Domain Controller that we are another Domain Controller and we want to synchronize the domain database. So we request the whole database which includes absolutely all the domain information, including NTLM hashes of every account in the domain. This database is named `NTDS` and is present in every domain controller.

So now let's use `impacket-secretsdump` to dump the NTDS.
![img_17](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_17.png)

### **PtH as Administrator**

Now we can use the Administrator NTLM Hash to perform a Pass-the-Hash attack. There are a lot of tools that support authentication using NTLM hashes, I'll use `evil-winrm`.
![img_18](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sauna/img_18.png)

This was a very easy machine, and it was enjoyable to work on, especially if you're unfamiliar with AS-REP Roasting and DCSync.
