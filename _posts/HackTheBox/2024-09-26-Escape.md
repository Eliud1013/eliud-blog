title: "HTB: Escape Writeup"
description: "Scape is a Medium Windows AD machine. It starts with an SMB share exposing a PDF containing MSSQL credentials. The attacker forces MSSQL to authenticate and captures a crackable hash. With these credentials, they gain command execution using WinRM. Further enumeration reveals user credentials, and a vulnerable certificate template (ESC1) allows the attacker to request a certificate for the Administrator account, ultimately obtaining the Administrator's hash."

## **Machine Information**

### **Synopsis**

Scape is a Medium difficulty Windows Active Directory machine that starts with an SMB share that guest authenticated users can download a sensitive PDF file. Inside the PDF file temporary credentials are available for accessing an MSSQL service running on the machine. An attacker is able to force the MSSQL service to authenticate to his machine and capture the hash. It turns out that the service is running under a user account and the hash is crackable. Having a valid set of credentials an attacker is able to get command execution on the machine using WinRM. Enumerating the machine, a log file reveals the credentials for the user `ryan.cooper`. Further enumeration of the machine, reveals that a Certificate Authority is present and one certificate template is vulnerable to the ESC1 attack, meaning that users who are legible to use this template can request certificates for any other user on the domain including Domain Administrators. Thus, by exploiting the ESC1 vulnerability, an attacker is able to obtain a valid certificate for the Administrator account and then use it to get the hash of the administrator user.

```

We're clearly dealing with a domain controller, as it is running services such as DNS, Kerberos, LDAP, etc. Besides the usual services, we can also see that the server is running MSSQL.

The script `ms-sql-ntlm-info` reveals the domain name (`sequel.htb`) and also the NetBIOS and DNS name for the domain controller.

```bash
1433/tcp  open  ms-sql-s      Microsoft SQL Server 2019 15.00.2000.00; RTM
| ms-sql-ntlm-info:
|   10.10.11.202:1433:

|     DNS_Computer_Name: dc.sequel.htb
|     DNS_Tree_Name: sequel.htb
|_    Product_Version: 10.0.17763
```

Let's add that hostname to our hosts file.

```bash
❯ echo -e "10.10.11.202\tsequel.htb dc.sequel.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
10.10.11.202    sequel.htb dc.sequel.htb
```

### **SMB Enumeration**

#### **Guest Session**

We can try to get a guest session on SMB, to do this we can use variety of tools, I'm going to use `Crackmapexec`.

To establish a valid guest session, we need to provide a username and an empty password. If we specify a username and a password or if we provide neither, we will get a valid SMB session but we will be unable to connect to any shared resources.

![img_2](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_2.png)
![img_1](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_1.png)

That's the case with any tool you use, this behavior has more to do with SMB and server configurations. If you provide a valid username, whether you provide a password or not you won't even get a smb sessios. This could be a way to enumerate users...
![img_3](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_3.png)

Now let's take a look at the shared resources...
![img_4](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_4.png)

We have access to `Public` share, I'm going to use `smbclient` and download its contents.
![img_5](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_5.png)

### **PDF Document**

If we open the document, we'll notice that Ryan has messed up by installing some kind of mock instance on the domain controller haha. By the way, at the end, there appear to be database credentials for new employees or something like that.
![img_6](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_6.png)

Let's try to access to the domain controller's MSSQL instance with those Credentials.

### **MSSQL Instance**

I'm gonna use Impacket's mssqlclient to access the database.
![img_7](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_7.png)
There are not tables besides of the default ones. We can try enabling xp_cmdshell but it will fail.

At this point, we can attempt to use the `xp_dirtree` stored procedure to trigger an NTLMv2 authentication and capture the hash using `Responder`.

![img_8](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_8.png)

And there it is... An NTLMv2 hash for the `sql_svc` user.

---

## **Foothold**

### **Cracking the Hash**

Now I'm gonna use `Hashcat` to try to crack that hash and get access to `sql_svc` account.

As Hashcat requires us to provide appropiate hash mode for NetNTLMv2, we can easily find it using `grep` and `--example-hashes` flag in Hashcat.
![img_9](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_9.png)

Now let's get the password for the `sql_svc` user.
![img_10](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_10.png)

### **Gaining a shell as sql_svc**

Now that we've gained access to a new account, I will quickly look for it's account memberships using `pywerview`, a Python implementation of `PowerView`.
![img_11](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_11.png)

As we can see, the `sql_svc` is member of `Remote Management Users`, which means that we can use WinRM to establish a remote PowerShell session. Let's use Evil-WinRM.
![img_12](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_12.png)

And nice, we've got a shell!

### **Ryan.Cooper Credentials**

Now that we have gained foothold, we could re-enumerate SMB shares providing credentials, enumerate LDAP, run SharpHound and analyze domain ACEs and so on. But first things first, why not start with some basic enumeration in the system?

If we go to the root of the filesystem, we'll notice a folder named `SQLServer`. Since our current user is `sql_svc`, why not we take a look?
![img_13](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_13.png)

We can see that there is a file named `ERRORLOG.BAK`. Since it contains a significant number of lines, I'll take a look at the entire file and then search by using keywords as I tend to miss things.
![img_14](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_14.png)

If we filter for some keywords such as password, user, login, we will find something funnny.
![img_15](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_15.png)
It seems that the user `Ryan.Copper` typed his password as a username, and MSSQL logged it as a failed login.

Now we can verify this credentials using Crackmapexec.
![img_16](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_16.png)
Specifying a invalid password is how we can determine wheter this user exists or not. If the user didn't exist we'd receive a valid SMB session. However, since the user exists we need to provide valid credentials to establish a session.

---

## **Privilege Escalation**

### **AD CS**

If we log in as `Ryan.Cooper` and list running processes, we'll notice that there is a service called `certsrv`, which is present on CA servers. CA servers do not necessarily have to be running on a DC; like KDCs, CA server might operate (and usually do) on dedicated servers.

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Temp get-process | select name

Name
----
certsrv <
csrss
csrss
dfsrs
dfssvc
dllhost
dns
dwm
fontdrvhost
fontdrvhost
Idle
ismserv
LogonUI
lsass
Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.WebServices
msdtc
Registry
services
smss
...
```

So, knowing that this AD environment has implemented AD CS, it's worth checking if we have enrollment rights in any templates, and then looking for misconfigurations. We might find some privilage escalation paths.

#### **BloodHound**

Enumerating certification templates manually can be exhausting. Fortunately SharpHound implements AD CS data collection methods.
This only works with `BloodHound Community Edition`, which you can download from it's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound.git)

![img_18](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_18.png)

Then, you can transfer SharpHound to the machine, execute it, and retrieve the domain information to your machine, then upload the data to BloodHound and start analizyng :D

If we search for the shortest paths from `Ryan.Cooper` to `Domain Admins`, we will find the following path:

![img_19](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_19.png)

Domain users can perform the ESC1 attack by using `UserAuthentication` template. This basically means that we can request a certificate that can be used for authentication and we have permission to specify a SAN (Subject Alternative Name) in our CSR (Certificate Signing Request), allowing us to authenticate as any user in the domain.

### **Certipy**

Certipy is an offensive tool for enumerating and abusing Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS). We can download it from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy).

#### **Finding Misconfigured Templates**

We can run the following command to enumerate misconfigured templates.

```bash
certipy-ad find -vulnerable -u "ryan.cooper" -p "NuclearMosquito3" -dc-ip 10.10.11.202 -stdout
Certipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

```

And again, we find that the `UserAuthentication` template is vulnerable to ESC1. We can use Certipy to request a certificate, and since we can specify a SAN we can set it to `Administrator` by specifying a user principal name using the `-upn` option:

![img_20](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_20.png)

And now we've got a PFX file that contains the certificate and a private key. I've really tried to get a shell using the certificate and private key with Evil-WinRM but it didn't work on this machine.I guess WinRM over HTTPS hasn't been implemented. IDK, just remember that Evil-WinRM has that feature.

#### **Getting Administrator Credentials**

Certipy has also a feature to get a NTLM hash along with a TGT:
![img_21](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_21.png)
Now we can perform a PtH to get a session as Administrator, I going to use `Evil-WinRM`.

![img_22](/assets/img/HackTheBox/Escape/img_22.png)
And that's it! We've got a shell as Administrator.
