## **Machine Information**

### **Synopsis**

Nest is an easy difficulty Windows machine featuring an SMB server that permits guest access. The shares can be enumerated to gain credentials for a low privileged user. This user is found to have access to configuration files containing sensitive information. Another user's password is found through source code analysis, which is used to gain a foothold on the box. A custom service is found to be running, which is enumerated to find and decrypt Administrator credentials.
