    "content": "Machine InformationSynopsisScape is a Medium difficulty Windows Active Directory machine that starts with an SMB share that guest authenticated users can download a sensitive PDF file. Inside the PDF file temporary credentials are available for accessing an MSSQL service running on the machine. An attacker is able to force the MSSQL service to authenticate to his machine and capture the hash. It turns out that the service is running under a user account and the hash is crackable. Having a valid set of credentials an attacker is able to get command execution on the machine using WinRM. Enumerating the machine, a log file reveals the credentials for the user ryan.cooper. Further enumeration of the machine, reveals that a Certificate Authority is present and one certificate template is vulnerable to the ESC1 attack, meaning that users who are legible to use this template can request certificates for any other user on the domain including Domain Administrators. Thus, by exploiting the ESC1 vulnerability, an attacker is able to obtain a valid certificate for the Administrator account and then use it to get the hash of the administrator user.

If we specify a username and a password or if we provide neither, we will get a valid SMB session but we will be unable to connect to any shared resources.That’s the case with any tool you use, this behavior has more to do with SMB and server configurations. If you provide a valid username, whether you provide a password or not you won’t even get a smb sessios. This could be a way to enumerate users…Now let’s take a look at the shared resources…We have access to Public share, I’m going to use smbclient and download its contents.PDF DocumentIf we open the document, we’ll notice that Ryan has messed up by installing some kind of mock instance on the domain controller haha. By the way, at the end, there appear to be database credentials for new employees or something like that.Let’s try to access to the domain controller’s MSSQL instance with those Credentials.MSSQL InstanceI’m gonna use Impacket’s mssqlclient to access the database.There are not tables besides of the default ones. We can try enabling xp_cmdshell but it will fail.At this point, we can attempt to use the xp_dirtree stored procedure to trigger an NTLMv2 authentication and capture the hash using Responder.And there it is… An NTLMv2 hash for the sql_svc user.FootholdCracking the HashNow I’m gonna use Hashcat to try to crack that hash and get access to sql_svc account.As Hashcat requires us to provide appropiate hash mode for NetNTLMv2, we can easily find it using grep and --example-hashes flag in Hashcat.Now let’s get the password for the sql_svc user.Gaining a shell as sql_svcNow that we’ve gained access to a new account, I will quickly look for it’s account memberships using pywerview, a Python implementation of PowerView.As we can see, the sql_svc is member of Remote Management Users, which means that we can use WinRM to establish a remote PowerShell session. Let’s use Evil-WinRM.And nice, we’ve got a shell!Ryan.Cooper CredentialsNow that we have gained foothold, we could re-enumerate SMB shares providing credentials, enumerate LDAP, run SharpHound and analyze domain ACEs and so on. But first things first, why not start with some basic enumeration in the system?If we go to the root of the filesystem, we’ll notice a folder named SQLServer. Since our current user is sql_svc, why not we take a look?We can see that there is a file named ERRORLOG.BAK. Since it contains a significant number of lines, I’ll take a look at the entire file and then search by using keywords as I tend to miss things.If we filter for some keywords such as password, user, login, we will find something funnny.It seems that the user Ryan.Copper typed his password as a username, and MSSQL logged it as a failed login.Now we can verify this credentials using Crackmapexec.Specifying a invalid password is how we can determine wheter this user exists or not. If the user didn’t exist we’d receive a valid SMB session. However, since the user exists we need to provide valid credentials to establish a session.Privilege EscalationAD CSIf we log in as Ryan.Cooper and list running processes, we’ll notice that there is a service called certsrv, which is present on CA servers. CA servers do not necessarily have to be running on a DC; like KDCs, CA server might operate (and usually do) on dedicated servers.*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\\Temp get-process | select nameName----certsrv &lt;csrsscsrssdfsrsdfssvcdllhostdnsdwmfontdrvhostfontdrvhostIdleismservLogonUIlsassMicrosoft.ActiveDirectory.WebServicesmsdtcRegistryservicessmss...So, knowing that this AD environment has implemented AD CS, it’s worth checking if we have enrollment rights in any templates, and then looking for misconfigurations. We might find some privilage escalation paths.BloodHoundEnumerating certification templates manually can be exhausting. Fortunately SharpHound implements AD CS data collection methods.This only works with BloodHound Community Edition, which you can download from it’s GitHub RepositoryThen, you can transfer SharpHound to the machine, execute it, and retrieve the domain information to your machine, then upload the data to BloodHound and start analizyng :DIf we search for the shortest paths from Ryan.Cooper to Domain Admins, we will find the following path:Domain users can perform the ESC1 attack by using UserAuthentication template. This basically means that we can request a certificate that can be used for authentication and we have permission to specify a SAN (Subject Alternative Name) in our CSR (Certificate Signing Request), allowing us to authenticate as any user in the domain.CertipyCertipy is an offensive tool for enumerating and abusing Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS). We can download it from its GitHub repository.Finding Misconfigured TemplatesWe can run the following command to enumerate misconfigured templates.certipy-ad find -vulnerable -u \"ryan.cooper\" -p \"NuclearMosquito3\" -dc-ip 10.10.11.202 -stdoutCertipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)[*] Finding certificate templates[*] Found 34 certificate templates[*] Finding certificate authorities[*] Found 1 certificate authority[*] Found 12 enabled certificate templates[*] Trying to get CA configuration for 'sequel-DC-CA' via CSRA[!] Got error while trying to get CA configuration for 'sequel-DC-CA' via CSRA: CASessionError: code: 0x80070005 - E_ACCESSDENIED - General access denied error.[*] Trying to get CA configuration for 'sequel-DC-CA' via RRP[!] Failed to connect to remote registry.

We can use Certipy to request a certificate, and since we can specify a SAN we can set it to Administrator by specifying a user principal name using the -upn option:And now we’ve got a PFX file that contains the certificate and a private key. I’ve really tried to get a shell using the certificate and private key with Evil-WinRM but it didn’t work on this machine.I guess WinRM over HTTPS hasn’t been implemented. IDK, just remember that Evil-WinRM has that feature.Getting Administrator CredentialsCertipy has also a feature to get a NTLM hash along with a TGT:Now we can perform a PtH to get a session as Administrator, I going to use Evil-WinRM.And that’s it! We’ve got a shell as Administrator."

    "content": "Machine Information  SynopsisBuilder is a medium-difficulty Linux machine that features a Jenkins instance. The Jenkins instance is found to be vulnerable to the CVE-2024-23897 vulnerability that allows unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. An attacker is able to extract the username and password hash of the Jenkins user jennifer. Using the credentials to login into the remote Jenkins instance, an encrypted SSH key is exploited to obtain root access on the host machine.  General Information            Machine      Nest                  OS      Linux              Dificulty      Medium              Stars      4.4              Release Date      12 Feb 2024              Machine Address      10.10.11.10      ReconNmapAs always, we start by enumerating services with Nmap. We need to find out what services is the machine exposing, so let’s scan for open ports, service versions and run some default Nmap scripts.We can see two ports open, SSH and a HTTP server running on port 8080. Based on the Nmap script results, we can see that the service running in that port is Jenkins. So let’s see what we can find.JenkinsJenkins is an automation tool mainly used to implement CI/CD in software projects. It allows development teams to automate repetitive tasks such as building, testing, and deployment.We can try to log in using some common credentials like admin:admin but it’s likely going to fail.We can see two user in the People section, jennifer and Anonymous; but it look’s like we won’t be able retrieve any useful information.As we can see in the lower right corner, this Jenkins is running version 2.441. The latest version as of today is 2.462, so it’s slightly outdated. We can search for some CVEs for that version. I’m going to use searchsploit like a good script kittie.Nice, Jenkins version 2.441 has a LFI vulnerability, let’s see more about it. If search for information about this vulnerability in Jenkins webpage, we’ll find the following details.  Jenkins uses the args4j library to parse command arguments and options on the Jenkins controller when processing CLI commands. This command parser has a feature that replaces an @ character followed by a file path in an argument with the file’s contents (expandAtFiles). This feature is enabled by default and Jenkins 2.441 and earlier, LTS 2.426.2 and earlier does not disable it.Jenkins CLICLI commands uh?, If we search for Jenkins CLI we’ll find documentation to download and run this CLI.Jenkins CLISo we can download the CLI application directly from the server using the URL http://10.10.11.10:8080/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar. Nice, let’s download the application and see what we can do…So, if we remember, the CVE-2024-23897 is mainly based on a feature of the args4j library, where any text written after a @ will be treated as a file path, and the content of that file will be used instead. As Jenkins uses this library to parse command-line arguments when processing processing CLI commands, we can specify filepaths with @ and see its content. As we can see in the image below, if we use a ‘@’, we will see that the server is trying to resolve the file and it throws an error related to this.If we specify an existing file, such as passwd, we will see only the first line of the output. The number of lines that we will receive depends in the command we use, the most commonly command used to exploit this vulnerability is connect-node. Anyway, we will see a lot of gargabe in the output. For each line in the file’s content, we see an error message, which makes it very annoying to read.We can use lookahead expressions improve the output, but this always depends on the file. These regex could supress the entire output.So now we can proceed to typical LFI enumeration, such as checking /etc/hosts, looking for private keys in home directories, enumerating /proc, etc.If we enumerate the environment variables we can find the jenkins home path in the variable JENKINS_HOME.Jenkins with DockerNow let’s create a local instance of Jenkins using Docker, this will simplify the work.docker image pull jenkins/jenkinsdocker container run --rm -p 8080:8080 --name \"jenkins_container \"jenkins/jenkins jenkins.shdocker exec -ti docker_container bashjenkins@c4d3a3bff4a9:/$We can check the environment variables or simply cd $JENKINS_HOME to get the Jenkins home directory inside the container. If list files in the Jenkins home folder we’ll find a directory called users. Jenkins stores all its users data in XML files located in the Jenkins home directory instead of using a database.In the users directory, there is a folder for each user in Jenkins, and it follows the structure: &lt;username&gt;_&lt;random_ID&gt;. This directory contains a lot of information in the config.xml file, including a hash for the user password. We can’t directly read these files using the LFI vulnerability, as we don’t know any user IDs. However, there is also a file named users.xml, in which we’ll find the information we need.jenkins@c4d3a3bff4a9:~/users$ cat ./users.xml&lt;?xml version='1.1' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;&lt;hudson.model.UserIdMapper&gt;  &lt;version&gt;1&lt;/version&gt;  &lt;idToDirectoryNameMap class=\"concurrent-hash-map\"&gt;    &lt;entry&gt;      &lt;string&gt;admin&lt;/string&gt;      &lt;string&gt;admin_8012578364264486861&lt;/string&gt;    &lt;/entry&gt;  &lt;/idToDirectoryNameMap&gt;&lt;/hudson.model.UserIdMapper&gt;jenkins@c4d3a3bff4a9:~/users$ cat admin_8012578364264486861/config.xml  | grep passwordHash      &lt;passwordHash&gt;#jbcrypt:$2a$10$yhJ5UZffrea8PGKLx1q59eSBEMBNIF9XLBeO81AILlpU9hbti0MPO&lt;/passwordHash&gt;jenkins@c4d3a3bff4a9:~/users$Cracking jennifer’s HashNow that we know this, we can try to get the hash for the user we saw earlier(jennifer).And there it is, now let’s crack it using Hashcat.❯ hashcat -a 0 -m 3200 ./jennifer.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt❯ hashcat ./jennifer.hash -m 3200 --show$2a$10$UwR7BpEH.ccfpi1tv6w/XuBtS44S7oUpR2JYiobqxcDQJeN/L4l1a:princessPrivilege EscalationWe can try using these credentials to get an SSH session, but this will fail. So, let’s loggin to Jenkins and see what we can do.By doing some seacrh, we’ll find that there are SSH credentials for the user root (username and private key).If we list the installed plugins, we’ll see that SSH Agent is installed. This plugin allow us to use SSH credentials in pipelines to authenticate, allowing us to execute commands on remote systems.Since we having credentials for jennifer account, we can create a pipeline and use root SSH credentials to execute commands with elevated privileges.From Jenkins dashboard we can go to New Item, click on Pipeline and then Ok.In this link we can see how to use ssh-agent library in a pipeline: SSH AgentBasically we need to define it like this:steps {    sshagent(credentials: ['ssh-credentials-id']) {      sh '''        &lt;Commands&gt;      '''    }}And the final result would be:pipeline {    agent any    stages {        stage('Evil') {            steps {                sshagent(['1']) {                    sh '''                       ssh -l root 10.10.11.10 whoami                    '''                }            }        }    }}After defining the pipeline workflow, we run the build and check the console output. We should see the command output.If you get an error related to host key verification just ignore the warning by using the flag -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no in the SSH command.So now we can read the root private key and get a shell.Now we read the root flag and we finish this machine.This was a very fun and realistic machine. I learned a few new things, specially about Jenkins."

    "content": "Machine Information  SynopsisSauna is an easy difficulty Windows machine that features Active Directory enumeration and exploitation. Possible usernames can be derived from employee full names listed on the website. With these usernames, an ASREPRoasting attack can be performed, which results in hash for an account that doesn’t require Kerberos pre-authentication. This hash can be subjected to an offline brute force attack, in order to recover the plaintext password for a user that is able to WinRM to the box. Running WinPEAS reveals that another system user has been configured to automatically login and it identifies their password. This second user also has Windows remote management permissions. BloodHound reveals that this user has the DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All extended right, which allows them to dump password hashes from the Domain Controller in a DCSync attack.

Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 134.97 secondsWe can see some interesting services running on the machine. Since it is running DNS, Kerberos, LDAP, etc; we can assume that we’re dealing with a domain controller. We can also see that the server is hosting a web server, so we definitely we must take a look at it.First, let’s obtain the domain name in order to add it to our hosts file. We can use crackmapexec for this.❯ crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.175SMB         10.10.10.175    445    SAUNA            [*] Windows 10 / Server 2019 Build 17763 x64 (name:SAUNA) (domain:EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)Now egotistical-bank.local will be resolvedWe can attempt to get null or anonymous sessions on SMB or LDAP, but note that this is likely to fail. So let’s take a look at the website…Analyzing the WebsiteIt appears to be a bank’s website, but I didn’t find anything interesting. There are some contact forms, but they don’t work, we’ll receive a Method not allowed HTTP response. I prefer to not to put effort into trying to making them work.If we scroll down in the about.html page, we will find the following:We see that there are some employee names. We can use these names to create a username wordlist to try to find valid usernames in the domain.Who knows?, they might have domain accounts, let’s figure out.To achieve this, I’ve created a basic Node.js tool that will do exactly what we need, you can download it from it’s GitHub repository:AD-Username-GeneratorGenerating a username wordlistWe can use curl and grep using LookAround expressions to easily extract the employes names the from the about webpage.Alternatively, we could simply copy the names and paste them into a file manually. I preffer to complicate things to myself.Well, once we have the employee names in a file, we can run the script to generate possible Active Directory usernames.There is also a great tool for generating this type of wordlist. You can download it from its GitHub repository if you prefer using Python: username-list-generatorNice, now that we’ve got a username wordlist, we can use Kerbrute to enumerate valid users through Kerberos. Kerbrute will request a TGT for every user in the wordlist without providing a password. If the user exists, the KDC will notify us that the user does not have the DONT_REQ_PREAUTH flag set. If the user does not exists, the KDC will return an ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN error. This way, Kerbrute can determine wheter a user exists or not.Obviusly, if the user has the DONT_REQ_PREAUTH flag set, Kerbrute will mark the user as valid.Cool, we’ve enumerated one valid user, that might be enough. Let’s find out.AS-REP RoastingNow that we’ve found a valid user, we can use impacket-NPUsers to check whether FSmith requires pre-authentication or not.Great, FSmith does not require pre-authentication to request a TGT from the KDC. This means we can send a KRB_AS_REQ message without providing the user password which will let us receive a KRB_AS_REP message, which contains the TGT, and the following items encrypted with a secret key derived from the user’s password:  Session Key  TGT Expiration Time  User NonceSo, when we attempt to take advantage of a user who has the DONT_REQ_PREAUTH flag set, we’re going to focus on bruteforce the mentioned package, not directly the TGT as the TGT is encrypted using a secret key derived from the user krbtgt password, which is a very large password. Although we don’t need to worry about this, as Hashcat will do all the stuff for us but is good to know this kind of things. Anyway we can refer to this process as TGT Cracking.Here we can take a look in the KRB_AS_REP package from Wireshark:We can see that there are two encrypted parts (enc-part): one is in the ticket part, which is the TGT , and the another at the same ticket level; is the data that the user can decrypt with his password.Now if we see again the encrypted data that we obtain using impacket-NPUsers, we’ll notice that is exactly the same value that we obtain from Wireshark in the user encrypted part (59b7fd23ed…..) but with some additional information that will help cracking tools to recognize the format ($krb5asrep$23$fsmith@EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL:).FootholdCracking the TicketTo crack the TGT we can use several tools, I prefer to use Hashcat, but John is a great option too.Hashcat need us to provide a hash mode with -m parameter. We can find the mode for AS-REP with the following command:Nice, the appropiate mode is 18200, now let’s see if we can get the password.  Used command:❯ hashcat -m 18200 -a 0 ./fsmith.kirbi  /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  Output:And we’ve got the password for the FSmith user:Thestrokes23Logging in as user FSmithNow we can use PywerView to see which domain groups FSmith belongs to.Remote Management Users… Nice, in that case let’s get shell using evil-winrm and read the user flag.Privilege EscalationSystem EnumerationNow that we’ve obtained a shell, we will proceed to enumerate the system. To do this, I’m going to use WinPeas.exe. Let’s see what we can find.If we search for the password keyword, we’ll find plain text autologon credentials for the user svc_loanmanager. I really got stuck with these credentials, because the user is actually svc_loanmgr and not svc_loanmanager , I guess the registry hive for autologons is outdated. Anyway, if we list user directories in C:\\Users\\, we’ll find the real username.Well, now let’s use evil-winrm again with these new credentials and continue enumerating with this new user.Since we have a service account we should consider using Bloodhound to easily look at that privileges do we have in the domain.I’m gonna use SharpHound to collect the domain data, you can download it from its GitHub repository:SharpHound.DCSyncIf we filter by Principals with DCSync rights, we’ll see the following:The user svc_loanmgr has DCSync rights; kinda strange permissions for a service account meant to manage loans.To exploit a domain using DCSync rights, we essentially tell the Domain Controller that we are another Domain Controller and we want to synchronize the domain database. So we request the whole database which includes absolutely all the domain information, including NTLM hashes of every account in the domain. This database is named NTDS and is present in every domain controller.So now let’s use impacket-secretsdump to dump the NTDS.PtH as AdministratorNow we can use the Administrator NTLM Hash to perform a Pass-the-Hash attack. There are a lot of tools that support authentication using NTLM hashes, I’ll use evil-winrm.This was a very easy machine, and it was enjoyable to work on, especially if you’re unfamiliar with AS-REP Roasting and DCSync."

    "content": "Basic ConceptsBefore diving into insecure deserialization, we first need to understand the concepts of serialization and deserialization and what their purposes are.Serialization refers to a process in which an object is converted into a format that can be easily transmitted or saved; deserialization is the opposite process, convert serialized data into a programming object.What is an object?An object in programming is basically an instance of a class; It refers to an encapsulated unit of data that has attributes and behaviors (methods and functions) that has been created using a predefined template (a class). These objects are created at runtime and are saved in our computer’s memory. Objects encapsulate the state and behaviors of data structures defined by a class.So, serialization is the process in which we take this unit of data (the class instance) from our memory and converting it into a byte stream that can be sent over a network or persist the object’s state by saving it to a file, for example.Then, deserialization refers to taking this byte stream from a file or from the network and convert it back to a class object in its original state; as we see in the image below.  refers to an ordered byte sequence that is used to represent data in a format that can be easily interpreted or processed.Practical Example: Serialization and DeserializationWe’ll be using NodeJs with the node-serialize npm package, as it has a very human-readable serialize format. On the other hand, some languages use binary serialization formats; Java for example. This makes the serialized object unreadable for humans or at least significantly less readable, as it will be represented in hex bytes, of course depending on the class used for serialize the object.For example, when we use the ObjectOutputStream class in Java to serialize an object; the serialized data may look something like this:AC ED 00 05 73 72 00 1F 6A 61 76 61 2E 75 74 696C 2E 4F 62 6A 65 63 74 24 50 65 72 73 6F 6E 0000 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00With that being said, let’s see some examples.Serialization with node-serializeSo, here we have an example of object serialization using node-serialize package; we defined a class named Person with two attributes (name and age) and a method named greet, then we created a instance of the class and save in the variable carlosObj; then we serialized the object using serialize.serialize function.const serialize = require(\"node-serialize\");// Class Definitionclass Person {  constructor(name, age) {    this.name = name;    this.age = age;  }  greet() {    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);  }}// Creating an Person instancelet carlosObj = new Person(\"Carlos\", 14);// Serializing carlosObjlet carlosObjSerialized = serialize.serialize(carlosObj);console.log(carlosObjSerialized);// Output: {\"name\":\"Carlos\",\"age\":14}But it seems like something is missing in the output… Oh right, where is the greet function?, Well, in Javascript the class functions are not stored within the class instance itself. So, carlosObj doesn’t directly store the greet function. Class functions are stored in the class prototype, this in order to save memory, as these class functions are ‘shared’ between same class instances.In order to serialize an object and perserve its functions, we need to use literal objects insetad of class objects. This is because declared functions in literal objects are stored within the object itself. So, let’s see how a serialized function looks.const serialize = require(\"node-serialize\");let luis = {  name: \"luis\",  age: 20,  greet: function () {    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);  }};let luisSerialized = serialize.serialize(luis);console.log(luisSerialized);// Output: {\"name\":\"luis\",\"age\":20,\"greet\":\"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function () {\\n    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);\\n  }\"}Weird… Adittionally if we want to save the serialized object in a file, it is something easy, we just need to provide three additional lines of code. Let me provide an example.const serialize = require(\"node-serialize\");const fs = require(\"fs\");let luis = {  name: \"luis\",  age: 20,  greet: function () {    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);  }};let luisSerialized = serialize.serialize(luis);let luisSerializedBytes = Buffer.from(luisSerialized);fs.writeFileSync(\"/tmp/luis.txt\", luisSerializedBytes);We converted the serialized data into a buffer of bytes. We then used fs.writeFileSync, specifing, the path where we want to save the file, and the data we want to write.❯ cat /tmp/luis.txt───────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────       │ File: /tmp/luis.txt───────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────   1   │ {\"name\":\"luis\",\"age\":20,\"greet\":\"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function () {\\n    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);\\n  }\"}───────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────Deserialization with node-serializeSo, now how can we convert that data back into a Javascript object?, That’s something easy. We just need to use the unserialize function and pass a serialized object to it. Let’s first see an example using:const serialize = require(\"node-serialize\");const fs = require(\"fs\");let luis = {  name: \"luis\",  age: 20,  greet: function () {    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);  }};let luisSerialized = serialize.serialize(luis); // This is the content of luis.txtlet luisObj = serialize.unserialize(luisSerialized);luisObj.greet();// Output: Hello, I am luisWe just passed luisSerialized as a parameter in the unserialize function; and that’s all. If we want to read the serialized object from a file, the process is quite similar.const serialize = require(\"node-serialize\");const fs = require(\"fs\");let serializedData = fs.readFileSync(\"/tmp/luis.txt\", { encoding: \"utf8\" });let luisObj = serialize.unserialize(serializedData);luisObj.greet();// Output: Hello, I am luisInsecure DeserializationInsecure Deserialization is a vulnerability that commonly occurs in web applications;this vulnerability arises when user-controllable data is deserialized without proper validations, this potentially allows an attacker to manipulate the unserialized objects behavior or even replace the serialized object with an object of a different class.Manipulating the class might result in an error, but before this happens, it is probably that the damage may be already done. Many deserialization-based attacks are completed before deserialization is finishedHow do insecure deserialization vulnerabilities arise?Deserialization-based attacks generally occur when a backend application trusts in users input and involves this data into a deserialization process. Developers should always try to avoid deserializing user-controllable data; but if this is needed, always implement mechanisms in order to validate the user input, libraries such as joi are a great option for verifying user-input.Basic ExampleAs we saw, the node-serialize package allows us to include functions in our serialized objects. This sounds good, right? Well, not at all. What happens if we pass an IIFE to the unserialize function?.. Yes, it will be executed. Let’s look an example.Generating a payloadTo achieve RCE, we can use child_process module in NodeJs and invoke exec within the function we’re serializing. Since we cannot add a IIFE directly in the object we’re serializing (becuase the function would execute when we serialize the object), we need to manually convert our function into an IIFE.We just need to add () after the closing bracket, in this case we don’t need to enclose the entire function with parenthesis. We could also need to scape backslashes.const serializer = require(\"node-serialize\");const obj = {  f: function () {    require(\"child_process\").exec(\"ls\", function () {});  }};let payload = serializer.serialize(obj);console.log(payload);Result:{\"f\":\"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function () {\\n    require(\\\"child_process\\\").exec(\\\"id\\\", function (stdin, stdout, sterr) {\\n      console.log(stdout);\\n    });\\n  }\"}Modified Output:{\"f\":\"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function () {\\\\n    require(\\\\\"child_process\\\\\").exec(\\\\\"id\\\\\", function (stdin, stdout, sterr) {\\\\n      console.log(stdout);\\\\n    });\\\\n  }()\"};Deserialize and ExecuteNow we can set up a Python HTTP server and try to get some file using curl command in the exec function and see if it works.Practical ExampleHere we have a registration form where we need to provide some information.When we submit the form, the server send us a cookie and we see the submtited information in the dialog.We can try to decode the cookie since it appears to be in base64. We see that it contains the information that we provided.The decoded data looks like JSON, so it may be deserialized in server-side…We can serialize an object that contains a function that will establish a TCP connection . If the data is deserialized without any sanitization or validation, we could potenttially achieve RCE.We need to convert our function into a IIFE and escape backslashes. Then we encode our payload in base64.Finally, we set up a TCP listener and set our payload as a cookie, when we refresh the page, the server will decode and deserialize our cookie, executing our function and sending us a shell."

Interesting…FootholdAnalyzing VB Project Source CodeSince we found a Visual Studio Project we can use it to analyze the source code.Oh no… I forgot about it — I don’t know Visual Basic, but no problem; there’s a great extension in Visual Studio that will help us convert an entire VB project code into C# code, just in case you prefer reading C# code.Here’s also the GitHub Repository of theextention.Another way to do this is building the source code and then analyze the binaries using dnSpy for example.  Taking a look to Main methodThe entry point for the project is in the Module1.cs class. It seems that this class is trying to create an instance of ConfigFile class using a file named RU_Config.xml, and then creating another instance for SsoIntegration class using ConfigFile object properties, such as, Config.Username and applying a method called DecryptString from the Utils class to Config.Password.  Decrypting c.smith passwordIf we run the application it will fail, since we don’t have the RU_Config.xml file… Or do we? Remember we saw an encrypted password that came from a file called RU_Config.xml?❯ smbclient \"//10.10.10.178/Data/\" -U \"TempUser\" -c 'get \"IT/Configs/RU Scanner/RU_config.xml\" -'Password for [WORKGROUP\\TempUser]:&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;&lt;ConfigFile xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"&gt;  &lt;Port&gt;389&lt;/Port&gt;  &lt;Username&gt;c.smith&lt;/Username&gt;  &lt;Password&gt;fTEzAfYDoz1YzkqhQkH6GQFYKp1XY5hm7bjOP86yYxE=&lt;/Password&gt;&lt;/ConfigFile&gt;getting file \\IT\\Configs\\RU Scanner\\RU_config.xml of size 270 as - (0.8 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.8 KiloBytes/sec)Well, we can copy this file into the project and see what happens.If we run the project, we will get an System.IO.FileNotFoundException, indicating that RU_Config.xml file could not be found.So we just need to copy RU_Config.xml file from the SMB Data Share to the path where the application is looking for it… And then the error will disappear.So, now we can simply print the SsoIntegration password attribute, as it contains the decrypted password.Another way to get the decrypted password is just calling the DecryptString method from Utils.cs class and pass the encrypted password as an argument, this is a more direct approach.So nice, we got credentials for c.smith user.First I am going use CrackMapExec to confirm if these are valid credentials.❯ crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.178 -u c.smith -p \"xRxRxPANCAK3SxRxRx\"SMB         10.10.10.178    445    HTB-NEST         [*] Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2 Build 7601 (name:HTB-NEST) (domain:HTB-NEST) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)SMB         10.10.10.178    445    HTB-NEST         [+] HTB-NEST\\c.smith:xRxRxPANCAK3SxRxRxAlright, now we’ve got access to c.smith account.

LIST will list the content of the actual directory (like ls).  SETDIR will change the current directory(like cd).  RUNQUERY will fail due an invalid database configuration.  DEBUG is unknown, it requires a password.Unfortunately, there isn’t much we can do with these commands. There is no point on navigate the file system if we can’t read files with RUNQUERY command.But we still don’t know what the DEBUG command does. If only we had the password…There ins’t much we can do with the HqkLdap.exe binary except waste our time trying to find something in it’s source code.If we remember there were a file named Debug Mode Password.txt, but it was empty.Damn, a dead end?! It was for me.ADS In SMB Share  ADS ConceptNTFS file systems have a feature called Alternate Data Streams, this allows you to add a another data stream to a file, this means that you can add aditional data to be associated with a file or directory beyond the standard data stream. This allow you to ‘hide’ any type of file within another one (executables, images, videos, etc). Something scary about ADS is that this attribute is not visible in Windows File Explorer, it doesn’t modify the size of the file and it will not change checksum values.While NTFS uses ADS primarily to store metadata and extended attributes, it can also be used to store files.If you want to know learn more about ADS, I’d recommend this article:How NTFS Alternate Data Streams Introduce Security Vulnerability.  Looking for ADS AttributeWe can return to the C.Smith SMB Share and search for detailed metadata information, we can do it using the allinfo &lt;file&gt; SMB command.❯ smbclient \"//10.10.10.178/Users/\" -U \"c.smith%xRxRxPANCAK3SxRxRx\"Try \"help\" to get a list of possible commands.smb: \\&gt; cd C.Smithsmb: \\C.Smith\\&gt; cd \"HQK Reporting\"smb: \\C.Smith\\HQK Reporting\\&gt; allinfo ./HQK_Config_Backup.xmlaltname: HQK_CO~1.XMLcreate_time:    Wed Aug  7 02:12:31 PM 2019 MSTaccess_time:    Thu Aug  8 03:59:35 AM 2019 MSTwrite_time:     Thu Aug  8 04:09:06 PM 2019 MSTchange_time:    Wed Jul 21 11:47:15 AM 2021 MSTattributes: A (20)stream: [::$DATA], 249 bytessmb: \\C.Smith\\HQK Reporting\\&gt;The primary data stream of a file is always named $DATA.

This folder contains two files:  HqkLdap.exe (the same binary found in C.Smith SMB share)  Ldap.confThe second one (Ldap.conf) seems very interesting.

If we decompile the HqkLdap.exe binary using dnSpy and navigate to MainModule class, we will see the purpose of Ldap.Conf. Let’s see where is being used.We can see that there are things happening here; the application is doing the following:1.- Verify the count of commandline arguments is equal to one.if (MyProject.Application.CommandLineArgs.Count != 1)2.- Verify that the file specified in the argument exists. (Here is where Ldap.conf must be)else if (!File.Exists(MyProject.Application.CommandLineArgs[0]))  Verify that the HqkDbImport.exe file exists.else if (!File.Exists(\"HqkDbImport.exe\"))4.- Break the file specified in the arguments into a string array separated by line feeds.string[] array = File.ReadAllLines(MyProject.Application.CommandLineArgs[0]);5.- Iterate over the string arrayforeach (string text in array){  ///}6.- Verify is the current string starts with “Domain=”. if it does, assign it as a property in the ldapSearchSettings object. Do the same for “User=” and “Password=” for the corresponging values in the string array.if (text.StartsWith(\"Domain=\", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)){\tldapSearchSettings.Domain = text.Substring(text.IndexOf('=') + 1);}else if (text.StartsWith(\"User=\", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)){\tldapSearchSettings.Username = text.Substring(text.IndexOf('=') + 1);}else if (text.StartsWith(\"Password=\", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)){\tldapSearchSettings.Password = CR.DS(text.Substring(text.IndexOf('=') + 1));}Once the ldapSearchSettings object has Domain, Username and Password attributes, it creates an instance of the Ldap class using these attributes. It then uses this instance to call the Ldap.FindUsers method and save the result in a generic list of strings.Ldap ldap = new Ldap();ldap.Username = ldapSearchSettings.Username;ldap.Password = ldapSearchSettings.Password;ldap.Domain = ldapSearchSettings.Domain;Console.WriteLine(\"Performing LDAP query...\");List&lt;string&gt; list = ldap.FindUsers();Then iterate through list of users, print each user’s value and execute HqkDbImport.exe /ImportLdapUser &lt;user&gt; for each one. We don’t know exactly what ‘HqkDbImport.exe’ does, but we know that it performs some kind of user import to a database.foreach (string text2 in list){\tConsole.WriteLine(text2);\tProcess.Start(\"HqkDbImport.exe /ImportLdapUser \" + text2);}When the program iterates over the file passed with the cmdline arguments we can see that it’s doing something to the password before assigning it to ldapSearchSettings.Password.else if (text.StartsWith(\"Password=\", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)){      ldapSearchSettings.Password = CR.DS(text.Substring(text.IndexOf('=') + 1));}It is applying a function named CR.DS to the password. Let’s investigate what this function does.We can see that CR.DS receives an encrypted string as a parameter, then passes it to CR.RD method as a parameter.Let’s see more about CR.RD:I don’t know exactly how this code works, but I know it decrypts an AES ciphertext in CBC Mode using a PBKDF2 key. So, we can try to use these values in order to decrypt the administrator password.We can get the encryption parameters looking at the encryption/decryption functions (CR.ES/CR.DS), let’s take a look into the decryption functions.public static string DS(string EncryptedString){    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(EncryptedString))    {    return string.Empty;    }    return CR.RD(EncryptedString, \"667912\", \"1313Rf99\", 3, \"1L1SA61493DRV53Z\", 256);}private static string RD(string cipherText, string passPhrase, string saltValue, int passwordIterations, string initVector, int keySize){    byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(initVector);    byte[] bytes2 = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(saltValue);    byte[] array = Convert.FromBase64String(cipherText);    ...}We can see that RD is receiving the parameters in the following order:cipherText, passPhrase, saltValue, etc. Based on the parameters DS passes to RD, we can conclude that:            Key      Value                  passPhrase      667912              saltValue      1313Rf99              passwordIterations      3              Init Vector      1L1SA61493DRV53Z              keySize      256      Decrypting Administrator PasswordWell, I came up with three differents way to do this.  Using Cyberchef  Copying the decrypt function (RD) and passing the encrypted password (just as we did with C.Smith’s password).  Copying the Ldap.conf file from HQK Service and pass it to the HqkLdap binary as an argument; then use breakpoints to read theldapSearchSettings Password property.else if (text.StartsWith(\"Password=\", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)){  ldapSearchSettings.Password = CR.DS(text.Substring(text.IndexOf('=') + 1)); // Here}I’m going to do the first one, as I already did the second one and I’m to lazy to do the third.CyberchefWe can use CyberChef to create the PBKDF2 key, and the use it to decrypt the password.To create the PBKDF2 key, we need the following values:  A Passphrase  The key size  Number of iterations  A salt value  Getting the keyNice, we’ve got the key; now let’s decrypt the password.  Getting the passwordAnd there it is the administrator password. Now let’s try to use these credentials to gain administrator access and read the root flag.❯ impacket-psexec Administrator:XtH4nkS4Pl4y1nGX@10.10.10.178Impacket v0.12.0.dev1 - Copyright 2023 Fortra[*] Requesting shares on 10.10.10.178.....[*] Found writable share ADMIN$[*] Uploading file kfKTarfJ.exe[*] Opening SVCManager on 10.10.10.178.....[*] Creating service kjNv on 10.10.10.178.....[*] Starting service kjNv.....[!] Press help for extra shell commandsMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.
