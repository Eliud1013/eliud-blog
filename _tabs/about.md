### Hello!

My name is Eliud Gaxiola, and I live in Mexico. I am currently in the seventh semester of my Software Engineering program at ITSON and am approaching graduation. As I near the completion of my degree, I am dedicating myself to expanding my knowledge in the field of cybersecurity through self-study. To sharpen my skills, I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on renowned platforms such as HackTheBox and TryHackMe.

I have developed a robust understanding of various aspects of the software development lifecycle, encompassing programming, database management, and the fundamentals of cybersecurity. My expertise extends to networking principles and operating systems, including both Linux and Windows. This comprehensive skill set equips me with a solid foundation to tackle diverse challenges in the realm of technology.
